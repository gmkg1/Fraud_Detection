# Fraud_Detection
Engineered a fraud detection model using Random Forest and SMOTE to combat severe class imbalance. The system focuses on maximizing recall (85%), successfully identifying a high percentage of true fraud cases. The solution is packaged as a Flask application for real-time inference and performance visualization.
